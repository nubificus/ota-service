# ota-service
ESP32 Component for performing Over the Air updates

## How to use
```
cd <path-to-your-esp-idf-project>
mkdir -p components
cd components
git clone https://github.com/nubificus/ota-service.git
```
Add the component to your project by simply adding the following line inside `idf_component_register()` of `<path-to-your-esp-idf-project>/main/CMakeLists.txt`:
```
REQUIRES ota-service
```
E.g:
```
idf_component_register(SRCS "test.c"
                       INCLUDE_DIRS "."
                       REQUIRES ota-service)
```
You may also have to add the following configuration to resolve some `mbedtls` issues:
```
idf.py menuconfig
```
and enable `Component config -> mbedTLS -> HKDF Algorithm (RFC 6859)`

Afterwards, you can include the component's header file:
```c
#include "ota-service.h"
```

## API Reference
```c
/* 
 * this function can be passed as an
 * argument in `akri_set_update_handler()`
 * so that it only runs when we receive a
 * POST request at `/update` endpoint.
 * */
esp_err_t ota_request_handler(httpd_req_t *req);
```

The component follows the secure OTA workflow when `OTA_SECURE` macro is defined. Otherwise, the update is insecure.
